# Standards Ontology (STO)
This repository host the development of the Standard Ontology. 
The Standards Ontology is used for describing standards and their relations. Characteristics of I4.0 standards
are described and these descriptions are exploited for classifying standards from different perspectives according
to reference architectures development in different countries. Moreover, semantics encoded in the Standard Ontology allows for the discovery of relations between I4.0 standards, and
for mappings across reference architectures proposed by different industrial communities such as RAMI, NIST, etc.

# Reused Vocabularies
